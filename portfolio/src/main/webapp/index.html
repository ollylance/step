            <p>Hi! My name is Oliver Lance and I am a STEP Intern here at Google this summer! I am very excited and eager to continue
                developing my skills in Web Development and specifically Web Applications. I have some previous experience with Web
                Developement but not a lot. I know HTML, CSS, and Javascript, but have never combined those elements with backend
                developement or any APIs. While I am upset that the original Internship has changed, these projects and this Summer seem
                to be still amazing and informative. I want to learn so much and believe I will be able to do this through this new program
                with Web applications. My team consists of Dom, Erica, and myself and we are led by Keith and Chris. <br><br>This introductory
                Portfolio is for you to get to know me a little better and I used it to try and extend my Web Development a little bit since
                I had a bit of extra time on my hands. Feel free to browse the website, look through my gallery of images, and read my blog?

                To start off, I like to go by Oliver or Olly, 
                either works! My pronouns are he, him, his. Currently I am a Freshman at 
                Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA. I am majoring in Information Systems and am looking to either get my
                minor or major in Computer Science as well. I want to take a few more classes before I make the decision. I have always
                loved to program and began when I was little with Scratch, a drag and drop type language. Pittsburgh is a wonderful city.
                There is so much to do and to see around and I recommend going there at least once! While I'm a Browns fan and not
                a Steelers fan, it will do.... Some of my other favorite sports to watch as Basketball and Baseball.
                I am a Clevland fan because my Dad grew up there, so I like the Cavs and the Indians also!

                        and the terrain as well as many other features. Check my video out

            I grew up in Lancaster, PA which is considered Amish Country. I went to Warwick High School and enjoyed my time there.
            Since I was 8 I have been swimming and I love sports, the outdoors, and anything active. I am currently on the CMU Swimming
            and Diving Team and had a decent first year. I held my bescit times an dimproved in a couple of events! On top of swimming,
            I really enjoy playing Disc Golf with my brother and Dad. We go out almost everyday now that we are quarentined. I almo
            like to hike and be outdoors. Before this internship I hiked the Standing Stone Trail, an 84 mile trail located in mid-Western
            Pennsylvania, by myself for 5 days. It was a little ambitious but a lot of fun!
